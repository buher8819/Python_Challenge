#1. The total number of votes cast
#2. A complete list of candidates who received votes

#5. The winner of the election based on popular vote

#1. We need to tell the computer to go through and count all the rows (votes) that
#are present.

#2. Go through all the rows, and store all the unique values for the candidates (we want all
# the candidates names, but only output them one time).

#3. and 4. Find all the votes that pertain to each candidate and take those values and divide
#them by the total number of votes (which we should already have).

#5. Identify the candidate that has the highest percentage (or number) of the total votes (popular
# vote) and assign that candidate name as the winner.
